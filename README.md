# Ansible-Docker-Socket

The is a multi-container demo using Ansible Playbook.  The only requirement is that you have docker installed you get a copy [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/). This demo was tested with Docker for Mac.

There are two containers in this demo, one container for the flask app and another for the redis database.  We will be running the Ansible command in a third container so you will not need to install anything other than docker
